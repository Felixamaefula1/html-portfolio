<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Amaefula Felix O. Born on the 9th of April. I am Currently a 400 level student in the department of Forensic Science, Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria.</p>
<p>
  I became enthusiastic about learning Web Development after reading through a few articles i saw online, the course outline and all that it entails on Udemy.
</p>
<p>
  I believe my motivation and drive came from the inaugural speech of Nelson Mandela in 1994. He said, and i quote;
</p>
<h3>
<p>
  “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. <br />
  Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. <br />
  It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. <br />
  We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' <br />
  Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. <br />
  Your playing small does not serve the world. <br />
  There is nothing enlightened about shrinking <br />
  so that other people won't feel insecure around you. <br />
  We are all meant to shine, as children do. <br />
  We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. <br />
  It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. <br />
  And as we let our own light shine, <br />
  we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. <br />
  As we are liberated from our own fear, <br />
  our presence automatically liberates others.” <br />
